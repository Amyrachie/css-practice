         <h1>My Love For Technology</h1>
         <p> <i>Technology is a passion</i> of mine and I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs. Whether its cloud services, or the future needs of a department’s wireless technology. Efficiency is huge to me, and I have a passion for finding new and more productive ways to reach goals. Mapping out the technological solutions for the future is an important way to ensure efficiency is reached in every process possible.Technology lets one have more free time,it makes one <b>smarter</b>,it helps one keep in touch,it's fun and gives better opportunities.
Technology saves time and money.</p>

          <h2>The Importance of CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, <i>CSS is fundamental to web design.</i> Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website. Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website are all controlled by CSS.
           <b>CSS allows you to control and adjust the design</b> and formatting of your entire website (no matter how big or small it is) from a single spot. This is done using what is called an external style sheet, inline and internal styling.CSS applies formatting (like fonts, colours, object positioning, and so on) on top of a page's raw structural framework.</p>

    <tr>
     <td>Margins can be set to zero and above like padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.</td>
     <td> Padding can be set to <i>zero pixels and above.</i> It can change its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. </td>
     <td><b>The CSS border properties</b> (border-style, border-color, border-radius and border-width) are used to specify the style color and width of the border.</td>
